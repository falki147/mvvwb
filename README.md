# MVVWB Wordpress Template
This template was developed for the [MVVWB Site](https://www.mvvwb.at/). It is a
very basic one and was only built to display posts in a blog like manner. It
isn't customizable because it was only developed for this specific site.

## Building
```
npm install
gulp --env=<production|development> --dest=<destination folder>
```
